## Project Overview

The Quadra project aims to create a website reminiscent of Netflix, featuring a dynamic homepage with distinct sections: <span style="color:#FFBC21;">Categories</span>, <span style="color:#FFBC21;">Random Movie</span>, and <span style="color:#FFBC21;">Wishlist</span>.

Users have the option to log in or sign up, enhancing their overall experience on the platform.

The homepage showcases a prominently displayed movie header along with relevant information. Notably, the header movie is not hardcoded; instead, it dynamically changes with each page load through a random function, ensuring a fresh experience every time the page is reloaded.

Clicking on a movie opens a dedicated page with comprehensive details, providing users with the ability to rate the movie using a star-based system: ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.
